  <h1>Week 1</h1>

  <p>The theme for my dataset will be centered around 'The Complete Roulette Recordings of the Maynard Ferguson Orchestra'</p>

  <h2>Challenges that arise from working with music and muisc-related data:</h2>

  <p>As a music student, and keen jazz drummer in my own time, sheet music can often times be vital to fully understand a jazz standard. Additionally I do have to admit, being a jazz drummer without sheet music is one-hundred percent doable compared to others in the band who almost certainly need sheet music to learn parts. But, I personally love reading sheet music, getting the part perfect down to a T, and then once I have fully understood the part i can then go on and stylise the part to my own drumming skills, adding in occasional fills, solos, and slighgtly changing any grooves. This overreliance on sheet music to learn jazz standards is extremely difficult as accessibility to sheet music, in my opinion, is incredibly low. Sheet music for a jazz band costs large amounts of money to purchase and then printing costs too, so unless you are in a band it can be incredibly difficuly to get a hold of individual sheet music parts. Distribution is also a relevant problem as, in my experience, all websites that sell sheet music ensure that once the buyer purchases the sheet music, they do not hold the right to photocopy the indiviual parts, meaning for every purchase of sheet music only allows the buyer to have one piece of sheet music per part. That being said, it is commonplace in my experience that all bands do indeed photocopy each part so there is multiple versions of the sheet music incase the original part becomes damaged or lost.</p>

  <h2>How does my selected theme display some of these challenges?</h2>

  <p>I love listening to Maynard Ferguson and drumming along to some of my favourite tunes of his but sheet music for his charts is very hard to come by and even when I can find it, it is usually a paywall that is quite significant in size. So I have to choose either to continue drumming along without sheet music or pay up to be able to read the music. It is a tricky dilemma as I can play to a decent level without the sheet music, but I feel conflicted as I love reading the music and understanding everything that is written.</p>

  <h2>The current manifestations of data relating to my selected theme, how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.</h2>

  <p>The way I currently find most of my data on most things Maynard Ferguson is through YouTube. Old performances are uploaded, along with (usually) Metadata about the performance such as:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Song Title</li>
    <li>Date of performance</li>
    <li>Where the performance took place or at what event</li>
    <li>Performers</li>
    <li>Lots of my listening is done on Spotify but as with a lot of older Jazz artists with potentiallyt hundreds upon thousands of live performances, Spotify is not always the most reliable for perfect chronology.</li>
  </ul>
