  <h1>Week 2</h1>
  
  <p>To preface: The task this week frustrated me as I felt it was incredibly inaccessible and I wouldn't have thought that we would be doing a task that is almost impossible to complete without paying or signing up to a website or subscription to be able to view sheet music. As a music and jazz student I know the difficulties of accessing sheet music, with mostly all of it behind some sort of paywall, so I found this mildly frustrating as I surfed the internet for what felt like an eternity just trying to find a piece of sheet music that would even work in MuseScore's conversion software.</p>

  <h2>The Task:</h2>

  <p>The OMR engine that is used is a useful piece of technology but it certainly has its downfalls. It can capture the general shapes, rhythms, and pitches of music quite well but can easily miss out on detailing. After converting my PDF into MuseScore, some rhythms and some pitches were correct but a lot of correcting was needed. All detailing was missed out (i.e. articulation, tempo markings, dynamics, etc) and several note lengths and pitches were slightly incorrect too.</p>
