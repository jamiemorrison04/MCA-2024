\[Challenges that arise from working with music and muisc-related data:]\
\[As a music student, and keen jazz drummer in my own time, sheet music can often times be vital to fully understand a jazz standard. Additionally I do have to admit, being a jazz drummer without sheet music is one-hundred percent doable compared to others in the band who almost certainly need sheet music to learn parts. But, I personally love reading sheet music, getting the part perfect down to a T, and then once I have fully understood the part i can then go on and stylise the part to my own drumming skills, adding in occasional fills, solos, and slighgtly changing any grooves. This overreliance on sheet music to learn jazz standards is extremely difficult as accessibility to sheet music, in my opinion, is incredibly low. Sheet music for a jazz band costs large amounts of money to purchase and then printing costs too, so unless you are in a band it can be incredibly difficuly to get a hold of individual sheet music parts. Distribution is also a relevant problem as, in my experience, all websites that sell sheet music ensure that once the buyer purchases the sheet music, they do not hold the right to photocopy the indiviual parts, meaning for every purchase of sheet music only allows the buyer to have one piece of sheet music per part. That being said, it is commonplace in my experience that all bands do indeed photocopy each part so there is multiple versions of the sheet music incase the original part becomes damaged or lost.]\
